Social Network API
## Description
### This is Module 18 challenge which I named social-network-api. This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Moment.js to format timestamps. The seed data is created using Insomnia.

### Here is the Screenshot of when the command to invoke the application is entered, the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
